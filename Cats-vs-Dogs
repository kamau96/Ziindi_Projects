Using a large dataset of labeled images, the model learns to pick up on subtle visual cues like fur texture, facial structure, and posture, enabling it to classify new, unseen images with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n## Objectives\n\n* Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand image characteristics.\n* Apply **preprocessing and data augmentation** to enhance model performance.\n* Build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for binary classification.\n* Validate the model’s performance on **unseen test data** for real-world applicability.\n\n---\n\n## Outcomes\n\n* A trained, ready-to-use CNN model capable of accurately predicting whether an image contains a **cat** or a **dog**.\n* Insights into **image-based machine learning workflows**, from dataset preparation to deployment.\n* A documented, reproducible pipeline that can be adapted to other classification problems.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import zipfile\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport scipy.ndimage as ndi\nfrom pathlib import Path","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-14T19:26:01.158968Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-14T19:26:01.159220Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-14T19:26:01.950962Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-14T19:26:01.159191Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-14T19:26:01.950051Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"zip_path = \"/kaggle/input/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/\"\n\ndef extract_files(path, data_type):\n    with zipfile.ZipFile(path+data_type, 'r') as zip_ref:\n        zip_ref.extractall(\".\") \nextract_files(zip_path, \"train.zip\")\nextract_files(zip_path, \"test.zip\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-14T19:26:01.951989Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-14T19:26:01.952482Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-14T19:26:20.507923Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-14T19:26:01.952454Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-14T19:26:20.507010Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_path = \"/kaggle/working/train\"\ntest_path = \"/kaggle/working/test\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-14T19:26:20.509588Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-14T19:26:20.509942Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-14T19:26:20.514096Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-14T19:26:20.509914Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-14T19:26:20.513167Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def load_images_labels(images, path, labels=None):\n    for file in Path(path).glob(\"*.jpg\"):\n        image = plt.imread(file)\n        images.append(image)\n\n        if labels is not None:\n            label = file.stem.split(\".\")[0]\n            labels.append(label)\n            \n    return images, labels","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-14T19:34:09.580903Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-14T19:34:09.581223Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-14T19:34:09.586494Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-14T19:34:09.581201Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-14T19:34:09.585649Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_images, labels = load_images_labels(list(), train_path, list())\ntest_images, _ = load_images_labels(list(), test_path)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-14T19:34:33.955342Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-14T19:34:33.955671Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-14T19:35:51.524124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-14T19:34:33.955641Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-14T19:35:51.523358Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
